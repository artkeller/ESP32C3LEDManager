# ESP32C3_SuperMini_Plus_LED_Manager
This library provides a convenient and robust way to control the onboard blue LED and the onboard NeoPixel (WS2812B RGB LED) on the TENSTAR ESP32-C3 SuperMini Plus Development Board (V2.0 Red Board). It abstracts away the complexities arising from both LEDs sharing the same GPIO pin (GPIO8) and the specific timing conflicts that can occur.
